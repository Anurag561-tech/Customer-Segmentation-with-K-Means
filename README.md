# Customer Segmentation with K-Means

## Overview

Applied k-means clustering for customer segmentation to identify distinct customer groups based on demographic data. The goal was to enhance targeted marketing efforts and optimize resource allocation.

## Project Workflow

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and normalized the customer data to ensure consistent input for the model.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Conducted visual analysis to uncover patterns and correlations in the data.
- **Modeling:** Implemented k-means clustering to segment the customer base into distinct clusters.
- **Cluster Analysis:** Evaluated the clusters to identify key characteristics and create customer profiles.
- **Visualization:** Used 3D plots to visualize and interpret cluster distributions.

## Project Results

- **Cluster 1:** Affluent, educated, and older-aged customers—targeted with luxury offerings and loyalty programs.
- **Cluster 2:** Middle-aged, middle-income customers—offered family-oriented products and cross-sell opportunities.
- **Cluster 3:** Young, low-income customers—focused on affordable, entry-level products.

## Conclusion

The k-means clustering model successfully segmented customers into meaningful groups, enabling more precise marketing strategies and improved customer retention. The insights gained from this segmentation allow businesses to better understand their customer base and optimize their marketing efforts.
